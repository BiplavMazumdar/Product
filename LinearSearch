LinearSearch

A simple approach is to do a linear search, i.e  

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

int arr[] = {1,2,3,44,5};
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]==23){
                count++;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(count>0){
            System.out.println("3 is there");
        }else{
            System.out.println("3 is not there");
        }
