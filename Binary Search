Binary Search

int a[] = {12,23,4,2,34,122};
target = 34;

Binary search say take the midle number of the array

There are some steps which we have to follow 

setp 1 :- Find the midel element 

setp 2:- target > mid => search in the right else serch in the left 

setp 3:- If middle element == target 

This is my ans 

for middle  =  (1st ind + lst ind)/2

The total number of comparisons, therefore, is (n - 1) + (n - 2)...(2) + (1) = n(n - 1)/2 or O(n2)

If start > element this means element is not present
